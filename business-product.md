## New business of AI
https://future.a16z.com/new-business-ai-different-traditional-software/

AI companies don't have the same economic construction as software companies. They look more like traditional services companies. Many AI companies have
  - **Lower gross margins** due to heavy cloud infrastructure usage and ongoing human support
  - **Scaling challenges** due to the thorny problem of edge cases
  - **Weaker defensive moats** due to the commoditization of AI models and challenges with data network effects

Anecdotally, we have seen a surprisingly consistent pattern in the financial data of AI companies, with gross margins often in the 50-60% range – well below the 60-80%+ benchmark for comparable SaaS businesses. 
### Advice
- Eliminate model complexity as much as possible - unique model per customer versus those that share a single model(or set of models) among all customers.
- Choose problem domains carefully – and often narrowly – to reduce data complexity.
- Plan for high variable costs.
- Embrace services
- Plan for change in the tech stack
- Build defensibility the old-fashioned way
