Metacognition, or “thinking about thinking,” refers to your awareness of yourself as a learner and your ability to regulate your own learning.

Metacognition involves five distinct skills:
1. Assess the task—Get a handle on what is involved in completing a task (the steps or components required for success) and any constraints (time, resources).
2. Evaluate your strengths and weaknesses—Evaluate your own skills and knowledge in relation to a task.
3. Plan an approach—Take into account your assessment of the task and your evaluation of your own strengths and weaknesses in order to devise an appropriate plan.
4. Apply strategies and monitor your performance—Continually monitor your progress as you are working on a task, comparing where you are to the goal you want to achieve.
5. Reflect and adjust if needed—Look back on what worked and what didn't work so that you can adjust your approach next time and, if needed, start the cycle again.
