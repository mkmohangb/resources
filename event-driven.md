# Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. An event-driven system typically consists of event emitters (or agents), event consumers (or sinks), and event channels.An event can be made of two parts, the event header and the event body. The event header might include information such as event name, time stamp for the event, and type of event. The event body provides the details of the state change detected.[1]

Characteristics of Event data:[2]
- Data is Rich
- Data is denormalized
- Data is nested
- Data is schemaless
